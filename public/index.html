          Nobody knows exactly why, but vinyl records have had a recent
          explosion in popularity. Maybe it was the growing fatigue of endless
          streaming, or perhaps people just missed the feel of music they could
          actually hold. Whatever the reason, you can’t go anywhere anymore
          without seeing vinyls being sold. But what about vinyls being rented?
          That is where Mean Street Vinyls comes in. For a couple bucks a week,
          you can borrow an album here at Mean Street. No longer do you need to
          gamble large amounts of money on whether you like a vinyl or not.
          Simply rent it and test the waters. That way you can know for certain
          whether you want to purchase the vinyl down the road or not.
